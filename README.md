# Safestreets application RASD and Design Document <br />

Here is my university project for Software Engineering 2 course, it consists of realizing the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) and the Design Document (DD) for a real use case: Safestreets application. <br />
<br />
You can find the two documents here: <br /> <br />
RASD: https://github.com/SimoneSartoni/SoftwareEngineering2/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/RASD1.4.pdf <br />
Design Document: https://github.com/SimoneSartoni/SoftwareEngineering2/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/DD1.1.pdf <br /> <br />
Here is the class diagram and the Entity Relationship diagram we decided for Safestreets application: <br /> <br />
